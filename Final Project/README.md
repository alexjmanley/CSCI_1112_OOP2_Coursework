# Calorie calculator with GUI
## This Project is a calorie calculator determined by information entered by the user 
## The motivation for this project came from my interest in exercise, I thought this would be a good way to show what I have learned during this course 
## The only File needed to run this project is the Final_Project.java file put it in your favorite IDE and hit run. 
## I am most proud of The setOnAction buttons that would reset the PrimaryStage seen. 
It took me A while to find a way to make it work and When I did it felt amazing. I Ended up creating a private Stage variable in the class 
```
next.setOnAction(e -> {
			Scene scene = new Scene(lastPane(), 320, 250); 
			stage.setScene(scene); 
		});
```
## I am the only person who worked on this project for CSCI_1112_OOP2.
